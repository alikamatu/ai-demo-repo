## 4) Experiment Tracker Template

Use one row per post:

| Date | Platform | Series | Hook Type | Length | CTA | Watch Time | Completion | Shares | Saves | Result | Next Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Decision logic:
- If completion < baseline for 5 posts: shorten openings and tighten cuts.
- If shares low but watch time high: improve practical takeaway value.
- If comments high: turn top comments into next episode.

## 5) Weekly Review Questions

- Which 3 posts had best completion and why?
- Which 3 posts had best shares and why?
- Which hook style produced the strongest first-3-second hold?
- Which series deserves more volume next week?
- What should be stopped immediately?

## 6) Compliance QA Gate

Block publish if any answer is "No":

- Is the claim accurate and non-misleading?
- Do I have rights to media/music used?
- Are sponsorship/affiliate disclosures present if needed?
- Does the post avoid spammy/manipulative behavior?
- Is this version genuinely platform-native?
