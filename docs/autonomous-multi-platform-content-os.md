# Autonomous Content OS for TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and X

Last updated: February 14, 2026 (US)

## 1) Objective

Build a repeatable, largely autonomous content operation that:
- Publishes daily across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts, Facebook Reels/Page, and X.
- Maximizes retention, shares, and repeat viewership.
- Stays policy-safe and monetization-safe.
- Uses AI for speed while keeping human editorial control for high-risk decisions.

## 2) Non-Negotiable Rules

- Do not use fake location, fake engagement, or bot-style interaction tactics.
- Do not publish health/fitness claims that cannot be substantiated.
- Add affiliate/sponsorship disclosures when required.
- Keep one final human approval checkpoint before publish.
- Treat each platform as native, not copy-paste syndication.

## 3) Strategy Core

### 3.1 Brand Setup

- Brand type: faceless fitness transformation media brand.
- Creative model: one core character universe + multiple recurring series.
- Positioning: practical fitness motivation + process transparency.

### 3.2 Content Pillars (90-day baseline)

- `Pillar A: Transformation Story` (35%)
- `Pillar B: Training Mini-Lessons` (25%)
- `Pillar C: Nutrition and Recovery` (20%)
- `Pillar D: Mindset and Accountability` (15%)
- `Pillar E: Monetization/Promo` (5%)

### 3.3 Series System (for binge behavior)

- `Series 1`: Day-by-day transformation arc.
- `Series 2`: "Workout in 20 seconds" micro sessions.
- `Series 3`: Myth vs reality fitness claims.
- `Series 4`: Audience challenge responses.

Rule: every post must belong to a named series.

## 4) Platform Playbook

### 4.1 TikTok

- Primary KPI: 3-second hold, average watch time, completion rate.
- Posting: 2 posts/day.
- Format: 8-20 seconds, immediate hook in first 1 second.
- Strong patterns:
  - Loopable ending that naturally rewatches.
  - Story tension: struggle -> action -> visible change.
  - Comment bait through questions, not manipulation.

### 4.2 Instagram (Reels + Stories)

- Primary KPI: shares/sends and saves.
- Posting: 1 Reel/day + 3-6 Stories/day.
- Format: 10-25 seconds Reel with strong caption cover text.
- Strong patterns:
  - Educational carousel companion for top reels.
  - Story polls to generate next-day reel topics.

### 4.3 YouTube Shorts

- Primary KPI: viewed vs swiped away, retention curve, returning viewers.
- Posting: 1 Short/day.
- Format: 15-30 seconds with explicit narrative completion.
- Strong patterns:
  - Episode naming convention: `Day X / Goal Y`.
  - Pin comment with next episode teaser.

### 4.4 Facebook (Reels/Page)

- Primary KPI: watch time + meaningful interactions.
- Posting: 1 Reel/day + 1 engagement post/day.
- Format: native upload, slightly slower pacing than TikTok.

  - Community prompt posts tied to reel theme.
  - Use Meta Business Suite for queue control.

### 4.5 X

- Primary KPI: engagement depth (replies, bookmarks, profile visits).
- Posting: 3-5 posts/day + 1 thread/week.
- Format: short strong claims + practical takeaways.
- Strong patterns:
